    <h1>Limited Liability Companies</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The following are the advantages of a LLC:
      <ul>
        <li>Limits your liability if you get sued. In other words, if someone sues you, they can't reach your personal assets.</li>
        <li>Not taxed at the entity level. So the corporation does not pay any tax on its profits. You still pay tax your share of the company's profits.</li>
        <li>Very easy to set up and maintain. Less paperwork and corporate formalities than a C or S corporation.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The following are the disadvantages of an LLC:
      <ul>
        <li>Will need to be converted to a C corporation before you go public.</li>
        <li>May require you to pay more in self-employment taxes than an S corporation. Speak to a lawyer or accountant for more details.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Not legal advice. Speak to a business lawyer to determine which entity is best for your particular situation.</strong></p>
