    <h1>S Corporations</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The following are the advantages of a S corporation:
      <ul>
        <li>Limits your liability if you get sued. In other words, if someone sues you, they can't reach your personal assets.</li>
        <li>Not taxed at the entity level. So the corporation does not pay any tax on its profits. You still pay tax on distributions of profits to you.</li>
        <li>The usual type of entity for small businesses without many owners. You may be able to pay less self=employment taxes than with other entity types.  Speak to a lawyer or accountant for more details.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The following are the disadvantages of a S corporation:
      <ul>
        <li>Can only have a limited (100) number of owners.</li>
        <li>Requires an election be made with the IRS.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Not legal advice. Speak to a business lawyer to determine which entity is best for your particular situation.</strong></p>
