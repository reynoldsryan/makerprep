    <h1>C Corporations</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The following are the advantages of a C corporation:
      <ul>
        <li>Limits your liability if you get sued. In other words, if someone sues you, they can't reach your personal assets.</li>
        <li>Attractive to venture capital firms and other investors.</li>
        <li>The usual type of entity if you expect to go public.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The following are the disadvantages of a C corporation:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Taxed at the entity level.</strong> This means the corporation pays tax on any profits and then you will also pay tax on any distributions of profits you receive from the corporation.</li>
        <li>Requires more paperwork and other corporate formalities than LLCs.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Not legal advice. Speak to a business lawyer to determine which entity is best for your particular situation.</strong></p>
